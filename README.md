# Breast Cancer Classification
The project aims to develop different models to solve binary classification problems on the **CBIS DDSM**: Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography dataset. In particular, we will perform two binary classification tasks, breast abnormalities classification and breast abnormalities diagnosis, using different CNNs. In particular, we will perform the tasks with CNNs trained from scratch, with pre-trained CNNs, with a siamese network and using an ensemble technique.
